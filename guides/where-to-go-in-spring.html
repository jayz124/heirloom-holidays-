        <p class="article-lead">There's a narrow window each year — maybe six weeks — when the world is at its most beautiful. The light softens. Gardens that were bare in February erupt in impossible colour. Pavement cafés drag their tables back outside. It's the season when the best destinations feel like they exist just for you, before the summer crowds discover them too. These are the places we're booking our families into right now, and the hotels worth building your spring around.</p>

    <!-- 1. Marrakech -->
    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="marrakech">
        <h2>Marrakech — Before the <em>Heat</em></h2>
        <p>I'll be honest: I avoided Marrakech for years. Too hot, too hectic, too many people telling me to go. Then I went in March, and I understood immediately. The temperature was 24 degrees. The Majorelle Garden was drowning in bougainvillea. The souks were busy but not oppressive. You could sit on a riad rooftop at sunset with a glass of Moroccan rosé and hear the call to prayer echo across the medina, and it was, simply, one of the most beautiful things I'd ever experienced.</p>
        <p>Spring in Marrakech — March through early May — is the sweet spot. The jacaranda trees are in bloom, the Atlas Mountains still have snow on their peaks, and the city's best hotels are running at full capacity but haven't yet hit the shoulder-season premium pricing of Christmas and New Year.</p>

                <span class="property-location">Marrakech, Morocco</span>
                <h3>La Mamounia</h3>
                <p class="property-tagline">The grande dame of Moroccan hospitality — eight hectares of gardens inside the city walls</p>
                <p>La Mamounia needs no introduction, but it does deserve a specific recommendation: ask for a riad suite with a private plunge pool. They don't advertise these loudly, but they're the best family accommodation in the city. The children splash in the courtyard while you read on the terrace. Breakfast is in the garden — mint tea, msemen flatbreads, fresh orange juice from the hotel's own grove. The spa uses local argan oil and is genuinely outstanding, not just a hotel spa going through the motions.</p>

    <div class="guide-section reveal">
        <p>The other hotel worth knowing about is <strong>Selman Marrakech</strong>, which sits on the city's edge and feels like an entirely different world. There are Arabian purebred horses grazing on the lawns. The pool is 60 metres long with the Atlas Mountains as a backdrop. It's quieter and more spread out than anything in the medina — ideal if your family wants space and spectacle without the intensity of the old city. We often pair three nights at Selman with two at La Mamounia so families get the best of both.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guide-tip reveal">
        <p>Skip the big group tours of the souks — they're relentless. We work with a local guide named Youssef who takes families on a two-hour walk at their own pace, with stops for fresh-squeezed juice and a pottery workshop. The children love it, the parents actually enjoy it, and you come away with things you'll keep rather than things you'll regret buying.</p>

    <!-- 2. Japan -->

    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="japan">
        <h2>Japan — Cherry Blossom <em>Season</em></h2>
        <p>Every year I tell myself I won't oversell cherry blossom season. And every year, a family comes back and says it was the single most beautiful trip of their lives. There's something about Japan in late March and early April that transcends travel — it's closer to pilgrimage. The entire country pauses to watch the blossoms open, and there's a collective reverence for beauty that makes you slow down in ways you didn't know you needed to.</p>
        <p>The trick is timing. Cherry blossoms last about ten days in any given location, and the "front" moves from south to north. Tokyo typically peaks around March 25th–April 2nd. Kyoto follows about a week later. We always build itineraries that follow the bloom, starting in Tokyo and ending in Kyoto, so you're never chasing petals that have already fallen.</p>

                <h3>Four Seasons Kyoto</h3>
                <p class="property-tagline">An 800-year-old garden, a temple next door, and cherry blossoms reflected in an ancient pond</p>
                <p>The Four Seasons Kyoto sits within Shakusuien, a garden that has been tended for eight centuries. During sakura season, the cherry trees around the pond garden create a reflection so perfect it feels staged. It isn't. The hotel arranges private early-morning temple visits — you're inside the grounds of Tofuku-ji at 6am, before anyone else arrives, watching monks rake gravel in silence. That memory alone is worth the trip. Ask for a garden-view room on the ground floor; the children can step directly out onto the paths.</p>

    <div class="guide-section reveal">
        <p>In Tokyo, <strong>The Peninsula</strong> is our go-to. It overlooks the Imperial Palace moat and Hibiya Park, both of which are extraordinary during cherry blossom season. The hotel has a fleet of bespoke Rolls-Royces that can take you to the quieter hanami spots — Shinjuku Gyoen is the obvious choice, but the cemetery at Yanaka is hauntingly beautiful and far less crowded. For families spending more than three nights in Tokyo, we also love <strong>Aman Tokyo</strong> for its extraordinary calm — it feels like a monastery on the 33rd floor.</p>
        <p>One more note on Japan: build in a night at a traditional ryokan. We send families to Gora Kadan in Hakone, about 90 minutes from Tokyo by train. You sleep on futons, bathe in natural hot springs, and if the weather cooperates, Mount Fuji appears at breakfast like something from a woodblock print. Children are fascinated by it all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guide-tip reveal">
        <p>Book Japan for cherry blossom season by November at the latest. The Four Seasons Kyoto sells out its garden-view rooms eight months ahead. We have a standing allocation at the hotel, but even that has limits during peak sakura week.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. Barcelona -->
    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="barcelona">
        <h2>Barcelona — The Quiet <em>Season</em></h2>
        <p>Everyone visits Barcelona in summer, which is exactly why you should go in spring. April and May in Barcelona are extraordinary: 20–25 degrees, almost no rain, and the city's parks and terraces are alive without being overwhelmed. You can actually get a table at the good restaurants without booking three weeks ahead. The beaches are quiet enough to walk on. La Boqueria market is busy but navigable.</p>
        <p>The architecture is the obvious draw — Gaudí's Sagrada Família, Park Güell, Casa Batlló — but spring is also when Barcelona's neighbourhood life is at its best. Walk through Gràcia on a Saturday morning and you'll stumble into a local market, a man selling cava from his front step, children playing football in the square. It's the Barcelona that tourists rarely find in August.</p>

                <p class="property-tagline">Frank Gehry's golden fish glints at its base — beachfront, two Michelin stars, and the sea at your doorstep</p>
                <p>Hotel Arts is the hotel I keep coming back to in Barcelona. The location is unbeatable — directly on Barceloneta beach with panoramic Mediterranean views from every room. In spring, the beachfront terrace is warm enough for long lunches without the August crush. Enoteca, the two-Michelin-star restaurant, serves some of the best seafood in the city. But honestly, what I love most is stepping out the back door and being on the sand in thirty seconds. For families, the duplex suites on the upper floors have space that most Barcelona hotels simply can't offer.</p>

        <p>If you prefer to be in the thick of things, <strong>Mandarin Oriental Barcelona</strong> on Passeig de Gràcia puts you steps from Casa Batlló and La Pedrera. The rooftop terrace is one of the city's best-kept secrets — a lush garden above the Eixample grid where you can sip cava as the sun sets over Tibidabo. It's a more intimate hotel than the Arts, and the Blanc spa is outstanding. We usually suggest the Arts for beach-loving families and the Mandarin Oriental for culture-focused trips, but honestly both work brilliantly in spring.</p>

    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="rome">
        <h2>Rome — Wisteria & Golden <em>Light</em></h2>
        <p>Rome in spring is Rome at its absolute best, and I will fight anyone who says otherwise. The wisteria cascades over every terracotta wall. The light turns golden around 5pm and stays that way for two hours. You can eat outside at every meal without sweating. The Colosseum doesn't have a two-hour queue. The gelato tastes better because you're not desperate for it — you're choosing it, happily, because you walked past a place on a side street and it smelled extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The key to Rome with families is pacing. Don't try to do the Vatican, the Colosseum and the Pantheon in one day — you'll all hate each other by dinner. One big sight per morning, a long lunch, gelato, then an afternoon just wandering whatever neighbourhood you end up in. Trastevere is perfect for this: cobblestoned, vine-covered, and full of restaurants where the menu is whatever the chef felt like making that morning.</p>

                <p class="property-tagline">A Rocco Forte hideaway with terraced gardens between Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps</p>
                <p>The de Russie's Secret Garden is Rome's most coveted spring terrace — wisteria cascades down ancient walls while you breakfast on fresh cornetti and blood-orange juice. The location is extraordinary: Piazza del Popolo outside the front door, the Borghese gardens a five-minute walk above. What I love about this hotel for families is that the garden gives children somewhere to run around between sightseeing sessions — rare in central Rome. The Irene Forte spa is superb, using locally sourced botanicals. And Le Jardin de Russie restaurant does a Sunday brunch that is genuinely one of the best meals in the city.</p>

        <p>The other Roman address to know is <strong>Orient Express La Minerva</strong>, newly opened under the LVMH banner. It faces the Pantheon directly — you can see it from your bedroom window, lit up at night, and the effect never wears off. The rooftop restaurant serves contemporary Roman cuisine with that view as a backdrop, and the rooms blend Art Deco flourishes with original frescoed ceilings from the 17th-century palazzo. It's a more central location than the de Russie, which matters if you have smaller children who tire of walking.</p>

    <div class="guide-tip reveal">
        <p>The private Vatican tours we arrange start at 7:30am, 90 minutes before general opening. You walk the Sistine Chapel with maybe twenty other people instead of two thousand. It costs more, but it changes the experience from endurance test to genuinely moving. Book this specifically — standard tours, even "small group" ones, are still packed.</p>

    <!-- 5. Istanbul -->
    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="istanbul">
        <h2>Istanbul — Tulip <em>Season</em></h2>
        <p>Most people don't know that Istanbul has a tulip season. The flower actually originated in Turkey — the Dutch imported it — and every April the city plants over 30 million bulbs across its parks and roundabouts. Emirgan Park on the Bosphorus becomes a carpet of colour, and the gardens of Topkapi Palace are extraordinary. Combine that with 18-degree weather, the Bosphorus ferry rides in golden light, and a food scene that has quietly become one of the world's best, and you have one of Europe's most underrated spring destinations.</p>
        <p><strong>The Peninsula Istanbul</strong> is where we send families. It occupies a restored Ottoman-era building on the European shore, with rooms overlooking the Bosphorus strait toward Asia. The hotel arranges private boat transfers — infinitely more civilised than Istanbul traffic — and the hammam spa is the real thing, not a tourist version. For dinner, ask the concierge to book Mikla on the rooftop of The Marmara hotel: one of the best meals in the city, with 360-degree views that include every major landmark.</p>

    </figure>

    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="portugal">
        <h2>Portugal — Vineyards in <em>Bloom</em></h2>
        <p>Portugal is having a moment, and spring is when it's at its best. The Douro Valley is covered in wildflowers, Lisbon's miradouros are warm enough to linger at, and the Algarve has empty beaches with water that's actually swimmable (give it until late April). What I love about Portugal for families is that it feels genuinely relaxed — there's none of the frenetic energy of Spain or Italy. The pace is slower, the wine is exceptional, and the food is honest and affordable even at the very top end.</p>
        <p><strong>Six Senses Douro Valley</strong> is one of my favourite hotels in Europe. It's a 19th-century manor house overlooking the world's oldest demarcated wine region, and Six Senses has turned it into a wellness retreat without losing any of the character. Wine tastings, vineyard hikes, cooking classes with produce from the organic garden, an infinity pool that seems to pour into the valley below. Children love the outdoor activities — kayaking on the Douro, cycling through the vineyards — while parents gravitate toward the spa and the wine cellar.</p>
        <p>In Lisbon, <strong>Bairro Alto Hotel</strong> has the best rooftop in the city — sunset views sweep from the Tagus to the terracotta rooftops of Alfama. It's perched on the edge of the Chiado and Bairro Alto neighbourhoods, so you're steps from the best restaurants and the famous Tram 28 route. Spring is the sweet spot: warm enough for the terrace but before the summer crowds flood the narrow streets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guide-tip reveal">
        <p>Pair Lisbon and the Douro Valley on a single trip. The drive is about two and a half hours through beautiful countryside, or you can take the scenic Douro train line — it follows the river through gorges and past terraced hillsides. We always build in a stop at a quinta for lunch along the way.</p>

    <!-- 7. Somerset -->
    <div class="guide-section reveal" id="somerset">
        <h2>Somerset — The No-Fly <em>Option</em></h2>
        <p>Not every spring escape needs a flight. <strong>The Newt in Somerset</strong> is the most extraordinary country estate in England, and spring is when it's at its most magical. The parabola walled garden unfurls in waves of colour from March — cherry blossoms, magnolias, then the famous apple orchards that supply the estate's cyder press. There are woodland walks, a working farm, and a Roman-inspired Garden Spa that might be the best in the country.</p>
        <p>What makes The Newt special for families is the scale — 300 acres of gardens, farmland and ancient woodland, all yours to explore. Children can feed the animals, learn about cyder-making, and run around in a way that most hotels simply don't allow. The farmhouse cottages have their own gardens and kitchens, so you can spread out properly. And in spring, the lambs are in the fields, the bluebells are in the woods, and the whole place feels like stepping into a children's book illustration.</p>
        <p>It's two and a half hours from London, no flight required, no jet lag, no airport queues. For a long weekend in late March or April, there's genuinely nowhere better.</p>
